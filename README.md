# stringoscillation
Demonstrates left- and right moving waves on a closed string. Simply run the script. The only parameters are those of the function mode and the amplitude _amp_ of the oscillating modes.

## About the function mode
k is related to the relative speed of both waves: for k=1, we get a standing wave on the circle.
For k != 1 the roots of the wave move along the circle.
Note: there are no longitudinal degrees of freedom for strings as the physical solutions of the string
are described by 2(D-2) solutions

## About plotting
If you are running the code in a Jupyter environment, you need to activate plots in a separate window with the line 
```
%matplotlib
```
right before the import section.
